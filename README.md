# Bowls Booking App

# Overview
This project is being developed for a local Bowls club who are looking to transition some of their systems away from their current pen and paper methods, and replace them with a website for their members. The first areas they want tackled are rink bookings and event signups.

Due to the nature of the sport, with members tending to be getting on in years, one of the key priorities is simplicity of design. The user interface needs to be clear, easy to understand and simple to interact with, with a consistent user experience across desktop and mobile.

# Features
Based on discussions with the club the initial range of features they wish to have are as follows:

**Rink Booking:** Users will be able to see when each rink is available and make their own bookings, as well as viewing a list of all upcoming bookings and receiving email reminders the day before their booked session.

**Club Admin:** Club administrators should be able to specify when the rinks are available, and block off time periods for club events. When events are created it should notify all members of the new event, and admins will be able to see which members have signed up for the events.

**Event Signups:** Users can see upcoming events and easily register their interest to take part.
